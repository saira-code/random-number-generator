# Random Number Generator

## What did you learn while making this app?

I learned how to use Python’s `random` module to generate random numbers within a specified range. I also practiced using conditional statements to display different messages based on the generated number.

## What feature did you enjoy building the most?

I enjoyed adding the lucky message that appears when the random number is above 90. It made the app interactive and fun!

## What would you add next if you had more time?

I would add a user input feature where users can specify their own range for the random number. I’d also add a graphical interface to make it more user-friendly.
